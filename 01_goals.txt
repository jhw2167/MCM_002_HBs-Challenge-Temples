    	modImplementation ("com.github.iPortalTeam.ImmersivePortalsMod:q_misc_util:${immptl_version}")
    	modImplementation ("com.github.iPortalTeam.ImmersivePortalsMod:build:${immptl_version}")

	  maven {
        	name = 'JitPack'
	        url = 'https://jitpack.io'
    	}

	immptl_version=v3.2.7-mc1.20.1


	2. Forge version

7. Add API to common to call forge/fabric portals API dynamically
