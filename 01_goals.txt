Requirements
---

1. Create challenge_temple nbt structure
---

2. compile and get challenge_temple to spawn in world
---


3. create challenge_base 2x2 chunk structure
---
	- The floors and walls of a challenge room
	- to be used as the default template for a challenge

4. Spawn challenge_base in super flat dimension
---
	- SKIPPED
	- we perhaps want each challenge_temple to be its own structure

	- HACK for grid placement of structures

	loadRegistryContents
	


5. Create a superflat single biom dimension to host challenges
---
	- Created, structures still spawn, trying to turn them off


6. Spawn immersive portal that can travel to external dimension
---

	1. Add immersive portal dependency
	---
	fabric based portal gun mod adds it like this:

	modImplementation ("com.github.iPortalTeam.ImmersivePortalsMod:imm_ptl_core:${immptl_version}")
    	modImplementation ("com.github.iPortalTeam.ImmersivePortalsMod:q_misc_util:${immptl_version}")
    	modImplementation ("com.github.iPortalTeam.ImmersivePortalsMod:build:${immptl_version}")

	  maven {
        	name = 'JitPack'
	        url = 'https://jitpack.io'
    	}

	immptl_version=v3.2.7-mc1.20.1


	2. Forge version
	---

7. Add API to common to call forge/fabric portals API dynamically
---

	- using Blay's PlatformProxy system


8. Remodel 2x2 temple room
---

	- prevent portal from spawning in one room 0x0
	- 

9. Add support for exit portal
---

	- create syntax for building end portal
		- Create sample of implementation to determine space needed
		- 8x8 torched off area
		- 6x6 area from bottom right, structure placed in positive x,y,z direction
		- floor of portal exit equals floor of ground where designating torches were placed
		-
	- save structure as an nbt
		- needs to be location agnostic, radial symmetry
	- dynamically locate soul torches after challenge replacement
		- y -1 offeset structure placement
	- after each temple reset:
		- find soul torches
		- save challengeExitPos and exitPortalPos and exitPortal
		- places challenge_exit_00.nbt
		- find soul torches again
		- delete existing exit portal
		- create new exit portal and save
		- on server restart, ensure to reset challenge
	- set challenge end portal dynamically

	CHALLENGE SUBMISSION VERIFICATION
	1. Challenge submission matches existing naming convention
	2. Challenge submisison contains only 4 soul torches
	3. 


10. Add support for temple refresh on portal death
---

	- Establish hook to player death
	- trigger challlenge rebuild on player death
	- Define chest locations
	- Create challenge_chest type that is not refilled on challenge reset
	- Chests are reflled on challenge reset
	- Challenge_chests are cleared on challenge reset after being opened


11.
---

	Create Challenge class to store challenge metaData and settings

	Challenge Info:
		CHALLENGE_DB/CHALLENGE_TEMPLATE.json

	ChallengeDB:
	challenges.csv - input file, adding new challenge authors and names
	challenges_updated.csv - db file containing real time file id of challenge.json, 
	author and challenge common name, also binary indicating whether this challenge should be used

	Challenge JSON:
	"difficulty": "PEACEFUL | EASY | NORMAL | HARD | VERY HARD",	//0-4
	"lootPool": "minor | standard | major | epic | lengendary",	//0-4
	
	SEED: 234345

Blocks to map on startup:
	- soul torches
	- chests
	- wool
	- challenge_tanks

"all": "minecraft:block/glass"

15.
---

- harder to cheese temples
	- destroy items on ground on startup
	- break any blocks in the startup area
	- don't let anyone place blocks in the real world or drop items there

16.
---

Give player home button that can use to go to original temple spawn!!


17.
---

- need to buffer buildChallenge time to allow players to join in or near challenges


- joining in progress causes temple reload
- joining in progress causes duplicate portals
- joining in progress causes portals in wrong order
- joining in progress missses item return

hbs foundation
- handles to Overworld, Nether, end
- getTicksInSession


18.
---

- bugtest join in progress
- bugtest join and leave
- bugtest on complete shrine unloading

- shrine shutdown does not add player back into shrine after reload
- 


19. Instructions for builders
----

	- Main building materials
		- challenge steps, stairs, bricks, slabs
		- pushable brick, invisible brick, facade brick etc
		- explain redstone mechanics and sheers
		- challenge invisible brick, 
		- other things can be used as long as they don't provide overwhelming ammo to cheese
		

		* add challenge_grass
		

20.
---

	- Test challengeRules load
	- test random brick works differently each time - make dependent on seed and total deaths in challenge
	-

	- test challenge grass as well

	000000537

21. Add loot pools
---

	- hbChallengeTemplesLootPools
	- read in json, default is no loot in pool
	- copy datapack loot pool format

22. Add Challenge support for prerequisite challenge shrines and mod dependency
---

	-

How To Create a Block Entity and renderer

1. You need ChallengeChestBlockEntity extends (some block entity) and a constructor

public class ChallengeChestBlockEntity extends ChestBlockEntity {
    public ChallengeChestBlockEntity(BlockPos pos, BlockState state) {
        super( ModBlockEntities.challengeChest.get(), pos, state);
    }
}

2. We need a ModBlockEntities class to initialize the block entity:

public class ModBlockEntities {

    public static DeferredObject<BlockEntityType<BlockEntity>> challengeChest;

    public static void initialize(BalmBlockEntities blockEntities) {
        challengeChest = blockEntities.registerBlockEntity( id("challenge_chest"), ChallengeChestBlockEntity::new,
            () -> new Block[]{ModBlocks.challengeChest} );
    }
    
    private static ResourceLocation id(String name) {
        return new ResourceLocation(Constants.MOD_ID, name);
    }
}

	initialize from... CommonClass.init methods
