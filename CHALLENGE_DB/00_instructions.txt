json/ - folder containing json data of all challenges, all named after 9 digit id
nbt/ - folder of all nbt structure data for each challenge, labled by id and room piece id

genIds.py - generates new ids from challenges in challenges.py, RETIRED

rmChallenge.py - removes a challenge from json and challenges.csv
	- does not remove .nbt data, they will be overwritten

copyChallenges.sh
